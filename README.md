# Dependency Injection with .NET and C#

The code is this repo accompanies the blog post on my personal site [here](http://tomwarsop.com/blog/2024-03-28-dependency-injection-dotnet-csharp.html).

There are two solutions in this repo, one is an example without dependency injection and the other does the same but with dependency injection. Both can be ran in the same manner:

```
dotnet build
dotnet run
```
